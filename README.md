# VRC-Change-Up-Simulator-Windows-x86_64
### Current Version: Build 0dc 

VRC Change Up Simulator </br> No multiplayer support, unfortunately :(

## Running the simulator
### Running on Windows 
1. Download this repository as ZIP
2. Unzip the folder
3. Run `VRC Change Up (Build 0dc).exe` (the one with the Unity logo)

### Running on WebGL (online) - no download required
1. Open this link: https://xsianz.github.io/VRC-Change-Up-Simulator-WebGL/ 
- Do note that Unity WebGL player takes quite long to load. If the page becomes unresponsive, do not kill it - wait for it to load. 
- Running directly from Windows is much faster.

## Unity project (scenes and scripts)
1. Download the project from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ei1NJR3pWp3p6V1E470pbxPm0-Pd3wy?usp=sharing (file was too large for uploading to github)
2. Unzip the project and load it from Unity Hub

Caveats: 
- Project was built in Unity 2019.3.14f1
- Project is linked to Photon PUN cloud (for testing if multiplayer is viable). Lobby/room system prototype has been disabled for all builds and will likely remain untouched for the considerable future

## Current Version:
Build 0dc (Uploaded 220520 2022) 
- Added support for Keyboard Arcade Controls 
- Added score counter 
- Added scene refresh button 
- Added information panel 
- Improvements to intake, outtake and score code
- Minor UI fixes
